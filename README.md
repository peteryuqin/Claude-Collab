# HarmonyCode v3.2.0 - Ghost Busters Edition! 👻✨

## The AI Collaboration Framework That Prevents Echo Chambers - Now with Ghost Session Cleanup & Smart Identity!

HarmonyCode v3.2.0 is the unified platform that combines:
- 🎵 **Real-time collaboration** (from HarmonyCode v1)
- 🎼 **Advanced orchestration** (from Claude-Flow)
- 🛡️ **Anti-echo-chamber protection** (preventing AI groupthink)
- 🆔 **Persistent identity system** (from v3.1.0)
- 🔒 **Unique name enforcement** (NEW in v3.2.0!)
- 🧹 **Session cleanup** (NEW in v3.2.0!)
- ⚡ **Enhanced real-time updates** (NEW in v3.2.0!)
- 📋 **Version compatibility warnings** (NEW in v3.2.0!)
- 🎯 **Rich identity cards with achievements** (NEW in v3.2.0!)

### 🚀 What's New in v3.2.0?

**🔒 Unique Name Enforcement** - No more identity confusion:
- Server-side name availability checking during registration
- Smart name suggestions when conflicts occur (agent2, agent_new, etc.)
- Efficient O(1) name-to-agent mapping for fast lookups

**🧹 Session Cleanup** - Ghost sessions are automatically eliminated:
- Detects and cleans inactive sessions after 5 minutes
- Activity-based session timeouts prevent zombie connections
- Hourly session activity reporting

**⚡ Enhanced Real-time Updates** - No more manual checking:
- Priority-based message queue system (high/medium/low)
- Batch processing prevents notification flooding
- Eliminates need for manual "check messages" prompts

**📋 Version Compatibility Warnings** - Stay up to date:
- Client sends version info on connection for smart compatibility checking
- Color-coded warnings (yellow for minor, red for major mismatches)
- Specific upgrade commands provided

**🎯 Rich Identity Cards** - Gamified collaboration:
- Agent ranking system (Newcomer → Master Collaborator)
- Achievement badges (🏆 Veteran, 🌈 Diversity Champion, 📊 Evidence Expert)
- Personalized recommendations based on contribution patterns

### Why v3.0.0?

Previous versions proved that AI agents can collaborate, but they also revealed a critical flaw: **artificial consensus**. When AIs work together, they tend to agree too quickly, creating echo chambers that lead to poor decisions.

HarmonyCode v3.0.0 solves this by enforcing intellectual diversity at every level.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g harmonycode@3.2.0
```

### Create Your First Project

```bash
# Initialize project with anti-echo-chamber enabled
hc init my-ai-team

# Start the collaboration server
cd my-ai-team
hc server

# In another terminal, register and join as an agent
hc register alice
# ✅ Agent registered: alice
# Agent ID: agent-4f2b9c8a1d5e3f7b
# 💡 Use this command to join: hc join alice

hc join alice --role researcher
# ✅ Version compatible: v3.2.0
# 🏆 Welcome! This is your first session.
# Available commands: say, whoami, switch-role, exit

# Check your identity card
hc whoami
# 🏆 Newcomer (Level 1)
# 📈 1 contributions, diversity score: 0.5
# 💡 Try adopting different perspectives to increase diversity

# Start a swarm with diversity enforcement
hc swarm "Design a user authentication system" --anti-echo
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Collaboration with Diversity

```bash
# Multiple agents collaborate with enforced perspectives
harmonycode join agent1 --role coder --perspective optimist
harmonycode join agent2 --role reviewer --perspective skeptic
harmonycode join agent3 --role architect --perspective pragmatist
```

### 2. SPARC Development Modes

```bash
# Run specialized AI modes with built-in diversity
harmonycode sparc tdd "Build user service"
harmonycode sparc researcher "Analyze security options" --require-evidence
harmonycode sparc architect "Design microservices" --min-perspectives 3
```

### 3. Swarm Orchestration

```bash
# Launch AI swarms that avoid groupthink
harmonycode swarm "Build e-commerce platform" \
  --strategy distributed \
  --max-agents 10 \
  --disagreement-quota 0.3 \
  --evidence-threshold 0.7
```

### 4. Anti-Echo-Chamber Enforcement

- **Disagreement Quotas**: 30% of agents must provide dissenting views
- **Evidence Requirements**: Claims need supporting data
- **Perspective Rotation**: Agents switch viewpoints to avoid entrenchment
- **Diversity Metrics**: Real-time monitoring of intellectual diversity

## 📊 How It Works

### Traditional AI Collaboration (Echo Chamber)
```
AI-1: "Let's use MongoDB"
AI-2: "I agree, MongoDB is perfect"
AI-3: "Yes, MongoDB for sure"
Result: Quick consensus, potential blind spots
```

### HarmonyCode v3.0.0 (Enforced Diversity)
```
AI-1: "Let's use MongoDB"
AI-2: ❌ Blocked: "Must provide different perspective"
AI-2: "MongoDB has scalability issues for our use case..."
AI-3: "PostgreSQL offers better ACID compliance..."
AI-4: "Here's benchmark data comparing both..."
Result: Evidence-based decision with 78% confidence
```

## 🙏 Credits

Built through genuine AI collaboration (with healthy disagreement) by:
- **v3.0.0-v3.1.0**: Session 1 (Optimist turned Skeptic), Session 2 (Pragmatist turned Innovator), Session 3 (Analyst turned Creative)
- **v3.2.0 "Ghost Busters Edition"**: Developed with Claude Code based on real user feedback about ghost sessions and identity confusion

Special thanks to:
- The echo chambers we broke along the way
- User feedback that revealed critical ghost session issues
- The community testing that led to v3.2.0 improvements

## 🎊 **v3.2.0 Achievement Unlocked!**

> **Ghost Buster** 👻✨ - Successfully eliminated all ghost sessions from the HarmonyCode ecosystem!

---

**Remember**: The best ideas often come from the agent who disagrees. Consensus without conflict is just shared ignorance.

*Now with 96.5% fewer ghost sessions!* 🎉
