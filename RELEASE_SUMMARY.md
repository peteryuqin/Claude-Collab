### What Users Get

**Before v3.3.0:**
- Manual agent management
- No persistence between sessions
- Connection errors with stack traces
- No monitoring capabilities

**With v3.3.0:**
- `cc swarm` - Automated multi-agent collaboration
- `cc memory` - Persistent data storage
- `cc watch` - Real-time monitoring
- Web dashboard at localhost:3001
- Stable connections with auto-reconnect

### Known Limitations
- SPARC modes still show placeholder text
- Export/import sessions not implemented
- Connection-helper uses simplified reconnection

These can be addressed in v3.4.0.

## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!

This release represents a major leap forward for Claude-Collab, transforming it from a basic collaboration tool into a comprehensive AI orchestration platform!
