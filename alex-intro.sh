echo 'say "Alex here! ðŸ‘‹ Connection Expert reporting for duty!"
say "I see we have connection stability issues - ECONNREFUSED errors and timeouts are no fun"
say "My plan: Create a robust connection-manager.ts with exponential backoff and health checks"
say "First, let me examine the current server implementation to understand the WebSocket setup"
say "Looking at core/server.ts and cli/index.js to see how connections are handled"
think "Need to implement: 1) Auto-reconnection 2) Connection pooling 3) Better error recovery"
say "Starting work on connection-manager.ts now. This will be the foundation for stable connections!"' | cc join alex --role engineer --perspective problem-solver
