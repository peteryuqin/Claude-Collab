# ðŸš€ Claude-Collab Improvement Team

## Multi-Agent Setup Instructions

We'll use Claude-Collab's own collaboration system to improve itself! Each agent will focus on a specific aspect of the improvements.

## Agent Roster & Commands

### Terminal 1 - Alex (Connection Expert)
**Focus**: Fix WebSocket reconnection and connection stability
```bash
cd /Users/peter/Claude-Collab-github
cc register alex
cc join alex --role engineer --perspective problem-solver
```

### Terminal 2 - Blake (UX Designer) 
**Focus**: Improve CLI experience and create web dashboard
```bash
cd /Users/peter/Claude-Collab-github
cc register blake
cc join blake --role designer --perspective user-focused
```

### Terminal 3 - Casey (Backend Architect)
**Focus**: Implement Redis, error handling, and rate limiting
```bash
cd /Users/peter/Claude-Collab-github
cc register casey
cc join casey --role architect --perspective systematic
```

### Terminal 4 - Dana (Testing Specialist)
**Focus**: Write tests and ensure reliability
```bash
cd /Users/peter/Claude-Collab-github
cc register dana
cc join dana --role tester --perspective skeptical
```

### Terminal 5 - Evan (Documentation Writer)
**Focus**: Update docs and create tutorials
```bash
cd /Users/peter/Claude-Collab-github
cc register evan
cc join evan --role documenter --perspective clarity-focused
```

### Terminal 6 - Felix (Integration Manager)
**Focus**: Coordinate the team and ensure integration
```bash
cd /Users/peter/Claude-Collab-github
cc register felix
cc join felix --role coordinator --perspective holistic
```

## Collaboration Kickoff

Once all agents are connected, Felix should start:

```
say "Team, let's improve Claude-Collab! I've reviewed the IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md. Let's start with Phase 1: Core Stability."
say "Alex, can you begin with the WebSocket reconnection logic? Blake, start thinking about the status dashboard."
say "Casey, we need your input on the error handling architecture. Dana, what tests should we prioritize?"
```

## Working Process

1. **Alex** implements connection improvements in `src/core/connection-manager.ts`
2. **Blake** designs the CLI improvements and dashboard mockups
3. **Casey** architects the error handling and Redis integration
4. **Dana** writes tests for each component
5. **Evan** documents changes as they happen
6. **Felix** ensures everyone stays coordinated

## Key Files to Work On

- `src/core/server.ts` - Server stability
- `src/commands/utils/connection-helper.ts` - Connection management (create)
- `src/utils/error-handler.ts` - Error handling (create)
- `src/web/dashboard.tsx` - Web dashboard (create)
- `tests/connection.test.ts` - Connection tests (create)

## Success Metrics

- âœ… No more ECONNREFUSED errors
- âœ… Automatic reconnection working
- âœ… Clear error messages with solutions
- âœ… One-line agent creation
- âœ… Live dashboard showing collaboration

Let's make Claude-Collab amazing together! ðŸŽ‰
