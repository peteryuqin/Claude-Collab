# Changelog

All notable changes to Claude-Collab will be documented in this file.

## [3.4.2] - 2025-07-08

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Version Management
- Fixed hardcoded version number in server.ts (was showing 3.2.0 instead of actual version)
- Server now dynamically reads version from package.json

#### WebSocket Issues
- Fixed 'ws is not defined' error in CLI interactive mode
- Changed from undefined `ws` to `connectionHelper.ws`

#### Connection Stability
- Added heartbeat mechanism with ping/pong to maintain stable connections
- Heartbeat sends ping every 30 seconds, expects pong within 35 seconds
- Server now responds to ping messages with pong

#### Multi-Agent Collaboration
- **Fixed message loop issue** - agents were responding to their own messages infinitely
- Changed message type from 'broadcast' to 'chat' to match server implementation
- Added robust self-identification using server-assigned agent IDs
- Agents now properly track their own ID to prevent self-responses

### ‚ú® Improvements

#### Agent Intelligence
- Added role-specific response generators for meaningful conversations
- Agents now provide actual technical insights based on their roles:
  - Analyst: Technical feasibility and metrics
  - Strategist: Phased implementation approaches
  - Implementer: Technology stack recommendations
  - Validator: Scalability and compatibility concerns
  - Optimizer: Performance and optimization strategies

#### Response Logic
- Implemented perspective-based responses for different topics (API, security, etc.)
- Added 50% response probability to maintain diversity
- Random 2-5 second delays for more natural conversation flow

### üîß Technical Details
- Updated swarm-manager.js agent script generation
- Improved message structure handling with proper field checks
- Better error prevention with multiple ID validation methods

## [3.4.1] - 2025-07-08

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

#### Connection Stability
- Fixed undefined `ConnectionManager` error in CLI connection helper
- Rewrote connection helper to use WebSocket directly with proper reconnection
- Added exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
- Improved error messages for connection failures

#### Identity Manager Robustness
- Added JSON validation and automatic recovery for corrupted identities.json
- Implemented backup/restore mechanism for identity persistence
- Added safe parsing with field validation
- Atomic file writes to prevent corruption

#### Swarm Manager
- Fixed string escaping in generated agent scripts
- Properly handles objectives with quotes and special characters
- Uses JSON.stringify for safe string interpolation

#### Examples
- Updated all examples to use correct WebSocket message formats
- Fixed registration flow to match server expectations
- Added proper authentication after registration

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements

## [3.4.0] - 2025-07-07

### üéØ Practical Mode - Making Claude-Collab Actually Useful

#### Major Improvements
- **Practical Mode**: Set `PRACTICAL_MODE=true` to allow messages through with warnings instead of blocking
- **Reduced Diversity Threshold**: Lowered from 60% to 30% for more natural conversations
- **Fixed Intervention Messages**: No more "undefined" - clear reasons for diversity requirements
- **Warning Cooldown**: Added 30-second cooldown to prevent spam of diversity warnings
- **Better Session Names**: Fixed undefined session names in logs

#### New Features
