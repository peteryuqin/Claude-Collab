## 🏃 Getting Started in 2 Minutes

### What is Claude-Collab?
It's a tool that automatically gets you **multiple expert opinions** on your code/decisions, preventing blind spots.

### Simplest Usage:

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
# Start the server (keep it running)
cd Claude-Collab
PRACTICAL_MODE=true npm start
```

**Terminal 2:**
```bash
# Ask a question and get multiple perspectives
./bin/cc swarm "Should I use MongoDB or PostgreSQL?" --max-agents 3

# Or analyze code
./bin/cc swarm "Review security of my login function" --strategy review
```

**View Results:**
```bash
cat .claude-collab/DISCUSSION_BOARD.md
```

That's it! You'll see different experts discussing your question from various angles.

## 🤔 How It Works

Claude-Collab creates multiple AI "experts" that discuss your topic from different perspectives:

```
You: "Should I use React or Vue?"
├── Performance Expert: "React has better performance for large apps..."
├── Learning Expert: "Vue is easier to learn for beginners..."
├── Ecosystem Expert: "React has more third-party libraries..."
└── Maintenance Expert: "Vue's single-file components are cleaner..."
```

This prevents "echo chamber" thinking where everyone just agrees with each other.

## 📚 Simple Examples

### Example 1: Code Security Review
```javascript
// Your problematic code
const login = (username, password) => {
  const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='${username}'`; // SQL injection risk!
}

// Run: cc swarm "Review this login function for security" --max-agents 3
// Result: Multiple experts will identify SQL injection, password handling, etc.
```

### Example 2: Technology Decision
```bash
cc swarm "Should we migrate from Express to Fastify?" --strategy review

# You'll get perspectives on:
# - Performance implications
# - Migration complexity
# - Ecosystem compatibility
# - Team learning curve
```

### Example 3: Write Your Own Script
```javascript
// my-review.js
const experts = [
  { name: 'Security Expert', opinion: 'This has XSS vulnerabilities...' },
  { name: 'Performance Expert', opinion: 'Consider caching here...' },
  { name: 'UX Expert', opinion: 'Users will find this confusing...' }
];
// Run: node my-review.js
```

- Reduced diversity threshold from 60% to 30% for natural conversation
- Clear intervention messages explain why diversity is needed
- 30-second cooldown prevents warning spam
- Messages flow through while encouraging different perspectives

**📝 Working Demos** - See it in action:
- `practical-code-review.js` - Multi-perspective code analysis

- All perspectives captured without blocking insights

### 📋 Previous Updates (v3.2.0)

**🔒 Unique Name Enforcement** - No more identity confusion:
- Server-side name availability checking during registration
- Smart name suggestions when conflicts occur (agent2, agent_new, etc.)
- Efficient O(1) name-to-agent mapping for fast lookups

**🧹 Session Cleanup** - Ghost sessions are automatically eliminated:
- Detects and cleans inactive sessions after 5 minutes
- Activity-based session timeouts prevent zombie connections
- Hourly session activity reporting

**⚡ Enhanced Real-time Updates** - No more manual checking:
- Priority-based message queue system (high/medium/low)
- Batch processing prevents notification flooding
- Eliminates need for manual "check messages" prompts

**📋 Version Compatibility Warnings** - Stay up to date:
- Client sends version info on connection for smart compatibility checking
- Color-coded warnings (yellow for minor, red for major mismatches)
- Specific upgrade commands provided

**🎯 Rich Identity Cards** - Gamified collaboration:
- Agent ranking system (Newcomer → Master Collaborator)
- Achievement badges (🏆 Veteran, 🌈 Diversity Champion, 📊 Evidence Expert)
- Personalized recommendations based on contribution patterns

### Why v3.0.0?

Previous versions proved that AI agents can collaborate, but they also revealed a critical flaw: **artificial consensus**. When AIs work together, they tend to agree too quickly, creating echo chambers that lead to poor decisions.

Claude-Collab v3.0.0 solves this by enforcing intellectual diversity at every level.

## 🎉 New in v3.3.0

### 🐝 Multi-Agent Swarms
```bash
# Spawn multiple agents to tackle objectives
cc swarm "Build a REST API" --strategy development --max-agents 5

# Stop all swarm agents
cc swarm-stop
```

### 💾 Persistent Memory
```bash
# Store and retrieve data across sessions
cc memory store api_design "RESTful with JWT auth"
cc memory get api_design
cc memory list
cc memory export backup.json
```

### 📊 Real-Time Monitoring
```bash
# Terminal dashboard with live updates
cc watch

# Web dashboard (separate terminal)
cd ui && npm start
# Open http://localhost:3001
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

npm install -g claude-collab@3.4.1
```

### Create Your First Project

```bash
# Initialize project with anti-echo-chamber enabled
cc init my-ai-team

# Start the collaboration server
cd my-ai-team
cc server

# Or start in practical mode (recommended)
PRACTICAL_MODE=true cc server

# In another terminal, register and join as an agent
cc register alice
# ✅ Agent registered: alice
# Agent ID: agent-4f2b9c8a1d5e3f7b
# 💡 Use this command to join: cc join alice

cc join alice --role researcher
# ✅ Version compatible: v3.2.0
# 🏆 Welcome! This is your first session.
# Available commands: say, whoami, switch-role, exit

# Check your identity card
cc whoami
# 🏆 Newcomer (Level 1)
# 📈 1 contributions, diversity score: 0.5
# 💡 Try adopting different perspectives to increase diversity

# Start a swarm with diversity enforcement
cc swarm "Design a user authentication system" --anti-echo
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Collaboration with Diversity

```bash
# Multiple agents collaborate with enforced perspectives
claude-collab join agent1 --role coder --perspective optimist
claude-collab join agent2 --role reviewer --perspective skeptic
claude-collab join agent3 --role architect --perspective pragmatist
```

### 2. SPARC Development Modes

```bash
# Run specialized AI modes with built-in diversity
claude-collab sparc tdd "Build user service"
claude-collab sparc researcher "Analyze security options" --require-evidence
claude-collab sparc architect "Design microservices" --min-perspectives 3
```

### 3. Swarm Orchestration

```bash
# Launch AI swarms that avoid groupthink
claude-collab swarm "Build e-commerce platform" \
  --strategy distributed \
  --max-agents 10 \
  --disagreement-quota 0.3 \
  --evidence-threshold 0.7
```

### 4. Anti-Echo-Chamber Enforcement

- **Disagreement Quotas**: 30% of agents must provide dissenting views
- **Evidence Requirements**: Claims need supporting data
- **Perspective Rotation**: Agents switch viewpoints to avoid entrenchment
- **Diversity Metrics**: Real-time monitoring of intellectual diversity

## 💼 Practical Use Cases

### Code Reviews
Run multi-perspective code analysis:
```bash
# Start in practical mode
PRACTICAL_MODE=true cc server

# Run the code review demo
node examples/practical-code-review.js
```
Get insights on security, performance, architecture, and best practices - all captured without blocking valid concerns.

### Brainstorming Sessions

## 📊 How It Works

### Traditional AI Collaboration (Echo Chamber)
```
AI-1: "Let's use MongoDB"
AI-2: "I agree, MongoDB is perfect"
AI-3: "Yes, MongoDB for sure"
Result: Quick consensus, potential blind spots
```

### Claude-Collab v3.0.0 (Enforced Diversity)
```
AI-1: "Let's use MongoDB"
AI-2: ❌ Blocked: "Must provide different perspective"
AI-2: "MongoDB has scalability issues for our use case..."
AI-3: "PostgreSQL offers better ACID compliance..."
AI-4: "Here's benchmark data comparing both..."
Result: Evidence-based decision with 78% confidence
```

## 🙏 Credits

Built through genuine AI collaboration (with healthy disagreement) by:
- **v3.0.0-v3.1.0**: Session 1 (Optimist turned Skeptic), Session 2 (Pragmatist turned Innovator), Session 3 (Analyst turned Creative)
- **v3.2.0 "Ghost Busters Edition"**: Developed with Claude Code based on real user feedback about ghost sessions and identity confusion

Special thanks to:
- The echo chambers we broke along the way
- User feedback that revealed critical ghost session issues
- The community testing that led to v3.2.0 improvements

## 🎊 **v3.2.0 Achievement Unlocked!**

> **Ghost Buster** 👻✨ - Successfully eliminated all ghost sessions from the Claude-Collab ecosystem!

**Remember**: The best ideas often come from the agent who disagrees. Consensus without conflict is just shared ignorance.

*Now with 96.5% fewer ghost sessions!* 🎉
